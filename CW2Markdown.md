## Additional work

### HTML

The additional work for HTML was to make the web page accessible, such as by supporting vision-impaired users. ~~This has been achieved through using semantic element levels wherever possible, as well as descriptive element names / IDs. These can all be used by screen readers to better describe the page, and can be found throughout the three HTML files.~~

~~Additionally, and while whether this qualifies as an accessibility feature or not is debatable, I have included a dark mode toggle on all three web pages. The website will also detect whether the user's device prefers light or dark themes upon loading, and appear accordingly.~~

~~This was achieved by storing all colours used by elements as variables in the CSS file, allowing them to be altered by a JavaScript event handler. These variables were defined in the :root rule to ensure that they applied to every element on a webpage.~~

~~**Dark mode button:** Line 35 of all HTML files.
**CSS rules:** Lines 1-18 of projectAppearance.css.
**JS event handler definition and implementation**: Lines 7-33 of projectScriptingAndDBAccess.js.~~

Additional work not attempted.

### CSS

The additional work for CSS was to make the web page responsive, so that it adapts to different screen sizes. ~~As such, all CSS rules define dimensions, positioning, margins, padding, and font sizes in relative terms - percentages and viewport widths, respectively. This can be seen throughout projectAppearance.css.~~

~~I did intend to make the layout of the websites change if the viewport was small enough, to make the site more readable for mobile users, but with the general requirements being revised to define a specific layout, I did not feel confident in doing so, lest my alterations cause those earlier marks to be lost.~~

Additional work not attempted.

### JavaScript and Database

The combined additional work for JavaScript and the database was to write playwright tests for the third JavaScript requirement, as implemented in vehicleRegister.html. This has not been attempted.
