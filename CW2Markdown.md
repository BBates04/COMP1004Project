## Additional work

### HTML

The additional work for HTML was to make the web page accessible, as represented by scoring 100 on a lighthouse accessibility test. I passed them immediately, so am not able to provide line numbers.

### CSS

The additional work for CSS was to make the web page responsive, so that it adapts to different screen sizes.

This has not been attempted.

### JavaScript and Database

The combined additional work for JavaScript and the database was to write playwright tests for the third JavaScript requirement, as implemented in vehicleRegister.html.

I created the file additional-tests.spec.js to contain my own tests. My JS passes all of these tests.
